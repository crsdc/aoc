# Advent of Code

A two-part challenge is released each day from 1 to 25 December at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I'm using this to improve my Python (mostly), and whatever general skills come up.

Started in 2021, doing days 1-13 on the day they came out. Returned in 2022 to follow along live again. Also filled in a few solutions from other years.
